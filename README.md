This is an application to track information about your friends. You can
store general information about a friend: their first, middle and last
name, birthday, email, cell phone, and marital status. Additionally,
you can store links to their profile networks such as Facebook,
LinkedIn, Twitter, Google+, Instagram, and Pinterest among others. You
can also add a profile photo of your friend.

ChumMe offers the ability to add the interests of a friend. Also, you
can add thoughts about your friend, and these thoughts cannot be
deleted so you can always see the thoughts of a particular friend.
