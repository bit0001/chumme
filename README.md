# chumme
This is an application to track the information of your friends.
It is possible to store general information about a friend as
his/her first, middle and last name, birthday, email, cell phone,
and marital status. In addition, one can store links to their
profile networks such as Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, Google+,
Instagram, and Pinterest among others. One can also add a profile
photo of one's friend.

ChumMe also offers the possibility of adding the interests of
a friend. Last but not least, one can add thoughts about a friend,
and these thoughts cannot be deleted, so one can always see the
thoughts of a particular friend.
